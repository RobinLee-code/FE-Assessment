Front End Assignment


Instructions for compiling and running the code:

First you open up Visual Studio Code
Then you go to the File tab and select "Open file".
You will double click on the Project folder
Inside the Project folder you will double click on the index.html file.
It will then open up the file in Visual Studio Code.
Then you could either use the shortcut "ctrl + b (which will open up the html page in your browser.
Or you could right click and select"Open in browser" from the drop down list.
This will then open up the html file in your browser.


  


Brief overview of the architecture:

The API-which is the entry point to the backend.
This is the way that the front end and backend will work together.
Client-the HTML complaint browser ,using the DOM and the javascript loaded to manipulate it.
Front End - the API that the DOM is pointed to,containing both the get request and some AJAX style access points.
The front end this is developed using javascript-
which calls the webservice that conforms to an agreed protocol




Short summary of your choice of technology stack-why did you choose it and if you were to do it again,would you change anything?

I chose css,html ,jquery and javascript for this project because i believe that it would be easier for me to complete this project with this technology.
This does not mean that i am not comfortable with any other technologies.
Since i am always open to learning any other new skills.

If i was to do it again , I would incorporate Sass and Less.
I would utilize the css pre-processors as there are a range of features like functions,variables etc ,
and i would be very intrigued to use them aswell as the time that i could have saved if i used the pre-defined properties ,
rather than writing them over and over.

I went and did some research about these CSS preprocessors.

Using these preprocessors would have been better because:

1.Writing less code(saving time on big projects)
2.Building reusable libraries(Better organized code structure)
3.Future Proofing(Your code and career)
